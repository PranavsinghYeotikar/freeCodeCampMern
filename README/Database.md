# SQL
### Structured Data
Data is stored in tables with rows and columns,
like a spreadsheet.
### Uses SQL Language
You use structured queries (SELECT, INSERT, etc.)
to interact with the database.
### Best for Complex Queries
Ideal when you need relationships between data
like orders and customers.

# NO SQL
### Flexible Data Format
Stores data like JSON or key-value pairs â€”
good for changing data shapes.
### Uses Query Language or API
Each NoSQL database has its own way of querying,
often simpler and faster for certain tasks.
### Best for Big Data & Real-Time Apps
Great for fast-changing or huge amounts of data.
